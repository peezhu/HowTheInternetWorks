                  The Domain Name System (DNS) is a hierarchical and decentralized naming system for computers,
                  services, or other resources connected to the Internet or a private network. It associates various
                  information with domain names assigned to each of the participating entities. Most prominently, it
                  translates more readily memorized domain names to the numerical IP addresses needed for locating and
                  identifying computer services and devices with the underlying network protocols. By providing a
                  worldwide, distributed directory service, the Domain Name System has been an essential component of
                  the functionality of the Internet since 1985.
              </p>
              <p>
                  The Domain Name System delegates the responsibility of assigning domain names and mapping those names
                  to Internet resources by designating authoritative name servers for each domain. Network
                  administrators may delegate authority over sub-domains of their allocated name space to other name
                  servers. This mechanism provides distributed and fault-tolerant service and was designed to avoid a
                  single large central database.
              </p>
              <p>
                  The Domain Name System also specifies the technical functionality of the database service that is at
                  its core. It defines the DNS protocol, a detailed specification of the data structures and data
                  communication exchanges used in the DNS, as part of the Internet Protocol Suite.
              </p>
              <p>
                  The Internet maintains two principal namespaces, the domain name hierarchy[1] and the Internet
                  Protocol (IP) address spaces.[2] The Domain Name System maintains the domain name hierarchy and
                  provides translation services between it and the address spaces. Internet name servers and a
                  communication protocol implement the Domain Name System.[3] A DNS name server is a server that stores
                  the DNS records for a domain; a DNS name server responds with answers to queries against its database.
              </p>
              <p>
                  The most common types of records stored in the DNS database are for Start of Authority (SOA), IP
                  addresses (A and AAAA), SMTP mail exchangers (MX), name servers (NS), pointers for reverse DNS lookups
                  (PTR), and domain name aliases (CNAME). Although not intended to be a general purpose database, DNS
                  has been expanded over time to store records for other types of data for either automatic lookups,
                  such as DNSSEC records, or for human queries such as responsible person (RP) records. As a general
                  purpose database, the DNS has also been used in combating unsolicited email (spam) by storing a
                  real-time blackhole list (RBL). The DNS database is traditionally stored in a structured text file,
                  the zone file, but other database systems are common.
