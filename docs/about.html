                  Before we cover what the Internet is, we must define what a "network" is. A network is a group of
                  connected computers that are able to send data to each other. A computer network is much like a social
                  circle, which is a group of people who all know each other, regularly exchange information, and
                  coordinate activities together.
              </p>
              <p>
                  The Internet is a vast, sprawling collection of networks that connect to each other. In fact, the word
                  "Internet" comes from this concept: interconnected networks.
              </p>
              <p>
                  Since computers connect to each other within networks and these networks also all connect with each
                  other, one computer can talk to another computer in a faraway network thanks to the Internet. This
                  makes it possible to rapidly exchange information between computers across the world.
              </p>
              <p>
                  Computers connect to each other and to the Internet via wires, cables, radio waves, and other types of
                  networking infrastructure. All data sent over the Internet is translated into pulses of light or
                  electricity, also called "bits," and then interpreted by the receiving computer. The wires, cables,
                  and radio waves conduct these bits at the speed of light. The more bits that can pass over these wires
                  and cables at once, the faster the Internet works.
              </p>
              <p>
                  What is distributed networking, and why is this concept important for the Internet?
                  There is no control center for the Internet. Instead, it is a distributed networking system, meaning
                  it is not dependent on any individual machine. Any computer or hardware that can send and receive data
                  in the correct fashion (e.g. using the correct networking protocols) can be part of the Internet.
              </p>
              <p>
                  The Internet's distributed nature makes it resilient. Computers, servers, and other pieces of
                  networking hardware connect and disconnect from the Internet all the time without impacting how the
                  Internet functions — unlike a computer, which may not function at all if it is missing a component.
                  This applies even at a large scale: if a server, an entire data center, or an entire region of data
                  centers goes down, the rest of the Internet can still function (if more slowly).
              </p>
              <p>
                  How does the Internet work?
                  There are two main concepts that are fundamental to the way the Internet functions: packets and
                  protocols.
              </p>
              <p>
                  Packets
                  In networking, a packet is a small segment of a larger message. Each packet contains both data and
                  information about that data. The information about the packet's contents is known as the "header," and
                  it goes at the front of the packet so that the receiving machine knows what to do with the packet. To
                  understand the purpose of a packet header, think of how some consumer products come with assembly
                  instructions.
              </p>
              <p>
                  When data gets sent over the Internet, it is first broken up into smaller packets, which are then
                  translated into bits. The packets get routed to their destination by various networking devices such
                  as routers and switches. When the packets arrive at their destination, the receiving device
                  reassembles the packets in order and can then use or display the data.
              </p>
              <p>
                  Compare this process to the way the United States' Statue of Liberty was constructed. The Statue of
                  Liberty was first designed and built in France. However, it was too large to fit onto a ship, so it
                  was shipped to the United States in pieces, along with instructions about where each piece belonged.
                  Workers who received the pieces reassembled them into the statue that stands today in New York.
              </p>
              <p>
                  While this took a long time for the Statue of Liberty, sending digital information in smaller pieces
                  is extremely fast over the Internet. For instance, a photo of the Statue of Liberty stored on a web
                  server can travel across the world one packet at a time and load on someone's computer within
                  milliseconds.
              </p>
              <p>
                  Packets are sent across the Internet using a technique called packet switching. Intermediary routers
                  and switches are able to process packets independently from each other, without accounting for their
                  source or destination. This is by design so that no single connection dominates the network. If data
                  was sent between computers all at once with no packet switching, a connection between two computers
                  could occupy multiple cables, routers, and switches for minutes at a time. Essentially, only two
                  people would be able to use the Internet at a time — instead of an almost unlimited number of people,
                  as is the case in reality.
              </p>
              <p>
                  Protocols
                  Connecting two computers, both of which may use different hardware and run different software, is one
                  of the main challenges that the creators of the Internet had to solve. It requires the use of
                  communications techniques that are understandable by all connected computers, just as two people who
                  grew up in different parts of the world may need to speak a common language to understand each other.
              </p>
              <p>
                  This problem is solved with standardized protocols. In networking, a protocol is a standardized way of
                  doing certain actions and formatting data so that two or more devices are able to communicate with and
                  understand each other.
              </p>
              <p>
                  There are protocols for sending packets between devices on the same network (Ethernet), for sending
                  packets from network to network (IP), for ensuring those packets successfully arrive in order (TCP),
                  and for formatting data for websites and applications (HTTP). In addition to these foundational
                  protocols, there are also protocols for routing, testing, and encryption. And there are alternatives
                  to the protocols listed above for different types of content — for instance, streaming video often
                  uses UDP instead of TCP.
              </p>
              <p>
                  Because all Internet-connected computers and other devices can interpret and understand these
                  protocols, the Internet works no matter who or what connects to it.
              </p>
              <p>
                  What physical infrastructure makes the Internet work?
                  A lot of different kinds of hardware and infrastructure go into making the Internet work for everyone.
                  Some of the most important types include the following:
              </p>
              <p>
                  Routers forward packets to different computer networks based on their destination. Routers are like
                  the traffic cops of the Internet, making sure that Internet traffic goes to the right networks.
                  Switches connect devices that share a single network. They use packet switching to forward packets to
                  the correct devices. They also receive outbound packets from those devices and pass them along to the
                  right destination.
                  Web servers are specialized high-powered computers that store and serve content (webpages, images,
                  videos) to users, in addition to hosting applications and databases. Servers also respond to DNS
                  queries and perform other important tasks to keep the Internet up and running. Most servers are kept
                  in large data centers, which are located throughout the world.
