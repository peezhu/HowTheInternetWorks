              <p>
                  The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) was founded in 1994 by Tim Berners-Lee after he left the European
                  Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) in October, 1994. It was founded at the Massachusetts
                  Institute of Technology Laboratory for Computer Science (MIT/LCS) with support from the European
                  Commission, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), which had pioneered the ARPANET,
                  one of the predecessors to the Internet.[3] It was located in Technology Square until 2004, when it
                  moved, with CSAIL, to the Stata Center.
              </p>
              <p>
                  The organization tries to foster compatibility and agreement among industry members in the adoption of
                  new standards defined by the W3C. Incompatible versions of HTML are offered by different vendors,
                  causing inconsistency in how web pages are displayed. The consortium tries to get all those vendors to
                  implement a set of core principles and components that are chosen by the consortium.
              </p>
              <p>
                  It was originally intended that CERN host the European branch of W3C; however, CERN wished to focus on
                  particle physics, not information technology. In April 1995, the French Institute for Research in
                  Computer Science and Automation (INRIA) became the European host of W3C, with Keio University Research
                  Institute at SFC (KRIS) becoming the Asian host in September 1996.[5] Starting in 1997, W3C created
                  regional offices around the world. As of September 2009, it had eighteen World Offices covering
                  Australia, the Benelux countries (Netherlands, Luxembourg, and Belgium), Brazil, China, Finland,
                  Germany, Austria, Greece, Hong Kong, Hungary, India, Israel, Italy, South Korea, Morocco, South
                  Africa, Spain, Sweden, and, as of 2016, the United Kingdom and Ireland.

              <p>
                  In October 2012, W3C convened a community of major web players and publishers to establish a MediaWiki
                  wiki that seeks to document open web standards called the WebPlatform and WebPlatform Docs.

              <h1>HTML</h1>
              <p>
                  Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for documents designed to be
                  displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)
                  and scripting languages such as JavaScript.
              </p>
              <p>
                  Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents
                  into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally
                  included cues for the appearance of the document.
              </p>
              <p>
                  HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects
                  such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create
                  structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists,
                  links, quotes and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets.
                  Tags such as <img/> and <input/> directly introduce content into the page. Other tags such as
              <p> surround and provide information about document text and may include other tags as sub-elements.
                  Browsers do not display the HTML tags, but use them to interpret the content of the page.
              </p>
              <p>
                  HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as JavaScript, which affects the behavior
                  and content of web pages. Inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content. The World Wide Web
                  Consortium (W3C), former maintainer of the HTML and current maintainer of the CSS standards, has
                  encouraged the use of CSS over explicit presentational HTML since 1997.[2]

              <h1>CSS</h1>
              <p>
                  Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a
                  document written in a markup language such as HTML.[1] CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World
                  Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.[2]
              </p>
              <p>
                  CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and
                  fonts.[3] This separation can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in
                  the specification of presentation characteristics, enable multiple web pages to share formatting by
                  specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file which reduces complexity and repetition in the
                  structural content as well as enabling the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed
                  between the pages that share the file and its formatting.
              </p>
              <p>
                  Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the same markup page in
                  different styles for different rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice (via
                  speech-based browser or screen reader), and on Braille-based tactile devices. CSS also has rules for
                  alternate formatting if the content is accessed on a mobile device.[4]
              </p>
              <p>
                  The name cascading comes from the specified priority scheme to determine which style rule applies if
                  more than one rule matches a particular element. This cascading priority scheme is predictable.
              </p>
              <p>
                  The CSS specifications are maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). Internet media type
                  (MIME type) text/css is registered for use with CSS by RFC 2318 (March 1998). The W3C operates a free
                  CSS validation service for CSS documents.[5]
              </p>
              <p>
                  In addition to HTML, other markup languages support the use of CSS including XHTML, plain XML, SVG,
                  and XUL.
