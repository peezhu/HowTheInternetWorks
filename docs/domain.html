              <p>
                  A domain name is an identification string that defines a realm of administrative autonomy, authority
                  or control within the Internet. Domain names are used in various networking contexts and for
                  application-specific naming and addressing purposes. In general, a domain name identifies a network
                  domain, or it represents an Internet Protocol (IP) resource, such as a personal computer used to
                  access the Internet, a server computer hosting a website, or the web site itself or any other service
                  communicated via the Internet. In 2017, 330.6 million domain names had been registered.[1]
              </p>
              <p>
                  Domain names are formed by the rules and procedures of the Domain Name System (DNS). Any name
                  registered in the DNS is a domain name. Domain names are organized in subordinate levels (subdomains)
                  of the DNS root domain, which is nameless. The first-level set of domain names are the top-level
                  domains (TLDs), including the generic top-level domains (gTLDs), such as the prominent domains com,
                  info, net, edu, and org, and the country code top-level domains (ccTLDs). Below these top-level
                  domains in the DNS hierarchy are the second-level and third-level domain names that are typically open
                  for reservation by end-users who wish to connect local area networks to the Internet, create other
                  publicly accessible Internet resources or run web sites.
              </p>
              <p>
                  The registration of these domain names is usually administered by domain name registrars who sell
                  their services to the public.
              </p>
              <p>
                  A fully qualified domain name (FQDN) is a domain name that is completely specified with all labels in
                  the hierarchy of the DNS, having no parts omitted. Traditionally a FQDN ends in a dot (.) to denote
                  the top of the DNS tree.[2] Labels in the Domain Name System are case-insensitive, and may therefore
                  be written in any desired capitalization method, but most commonly domain names are written in
                  lowercase in technical contexts.[3]

              <hi>ICANN</hi>
              <p>
                  The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN /ˈaɪkæn/ EYE-kan) is an American
                  multistakeholder group and nonprofit organization responsible for coordinating the maintenance and
                  procedures of several databases related to the namespaces and numerical spaces of the Internet,
                  ensuring the network's stable and secure operation.[2] ICANN performs the actual technical maintenance
                  work of the Central Internet Address pools and DNS root zone registries pursuant to the Internet
                  Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) function contract. The contract regarding the IANA stewardship
                  functions between ICANN and the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) of
                  the United States Department of Commerce ended on October 1, 2016, formally transitioning the
                  functions to the global multistakeholder community.[3][4][5][6]
              </p>
              <p>
                  Much of its work has concerned the Internet's global Domain Name System (DNS), including policy
                  development for internationalization of the DNS system, introduction of new generic top-level domains
                  (TLDs), and the operation of root name servers. The numbering facilities ICANN manages include the
                  Internet Protocol address spaces for IPv4 and IPv6, and assignment of address blocks to regional
                  Internet registries. ICANN also maintains registries of Internet Protocol identifiers.
              </p>
              <p>

                  ICANN's primary principles of operation have been described as helping preserve the operational
                  stability of the Internet; to promote competition; to achieve broad representation of the global
                  Internet community; and to develop policies appropriate to its mission through bottom-up,
                  consensus-based processes.
              </p>
              <p>

                  ICANN's creation was announced publicly on September 17, 1998,[8] and it formally came into being on
                  September 30, 1998, incorporated in the U.S. state of California.[9] Originally headquartered in
                  Marina del Rey in the same building as the University of Southern California's Information Sciences
                  Institute (ISI), its offices are now in the Playa Vista neighborhood of Los Angeles in Facebook's old
                  office.
