              <h1>HTTP</h1>
              <p>
                  The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application layer protocol for distributed,
                  collaborative, hypermedia information systems.[1] HTTP is the foundation of data communication for the
                  World Wide Web, where hypertext documents include hyperlinks to other resources that the user can
                  easily access, for example by a mouse click or by tapping the screen in a web browser.
              </p>
              <p>
                  Development of HTTP was initiated by Tim Berners-Lee at CERN in 1989. Development of early HTTP
                  Requests for Comments (RFCs) was a coordinated effort by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)
                  and the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), with work later moving to the IETF.
              </p>
              <p>
                  HTTP/1.1 was first documented in RFC 2068 in 1997, and as of 2021, it (plus older versions) is less
                  popular (used by less than 41% of web sites; it's always a backup protocol) for web serving than its
                  successors. That specification was obsoleted by RFC 2616 in 1999, which was likewise replaced by the
                  RFC 7230 family of RFCs in 2014.
              </p>
              <p>
                  HTTP/2 is a more efficient expression of HTTP's semantics "on the wire", and was published in 2015,
                  and is used by over 50% of websites; it is now supported by virtually all web browsers[2] and major
                  web servers over Transport Layer Security (TLS) using an Application-Layer Protocol Negotiation (ALPN)
                  extension[3] where TLS 1.2 or newer is required.[4][5]
              </p>
              <p>
                  HTTP/3 is the proposed successor to HTTP/2,[6][7] which is already in use by 8.9% of websites; and is
                  used by over 7.3% of desktop computers (enabled by default in latest macOS), using UDP instead of TCP
                  for the underlying transport protocol. Like HTTP/2, it does not obsolete previous major versions of
                  the protocol. Support for HTTP/3 was added to Cloudflare and Google Chrome in September 2019,[8][9]
                  and can be enabled in the stable versions of Chrome and Firefox.[10]

                  Hyper Text Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) is the secure version of HTTP, the protocol over which
                  data is sent between your browser and the website that you are connected to. The 'S' at the end of
                  HTTPS stands for 'Secure'. It means all communications between your browser and the website are
                  encrypted. HTTPS is often used to protect highly confidential online transactions like online banking
                  and online shopping order forms.
