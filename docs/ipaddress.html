              <h1>IP ADDRESSES</h1>
              <p>
                  An Internet Protocol address (IP address) is a numerical label assigned to each device connected to a
                  computer network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication.[1][2] An IP address serves two
                  main functions: host or network interface identification and location addressing.
              </p>
              <p>
                  Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) defines an IP address as a 32-bit number.[2] However, because of
                  the growth of the Internet and the depletion of available IPv4 addresses, a new version of IP (IPv6),
                  using 128 bits for the IP address, was standardized in 1998.[3][4][5] IPv6 deployment has been ongoing
                  since the mid-2000s.
              </p>
              <p>
                  IP addresses are written and displayed in human-readable notations, such as 172.16.254.1 in IPv4, and
                  2001:db8:0:1234:0:567:8:1 in IPv6. The size of the routing prefix of the address is designated in CIDR
                  notation by suffixing the address with the number of significant bits, e.g., 192.168.1.15/24, which is
                  equivalent to the historically used subnet mask 255.255.255.0.
              </p>
              <p>
                  The IP address space is managed globally by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA), and by
                  five regional Internet registries (RIRs) responsible in their designated territories for assignment to
                  local Internet registries, such as Internet service providers (ISPs), and other end users. IPv4
                  addresses were distributed by IANA to the RIRs in blocks of approximately 16.8 million addresses each,
                  but have been exhausted at the IANA level since 2011. Only one of the RIRs still has a supply for
                  local assignments in Africa.[6] Some IPv4 addresses are reserved for private networks and are not
                  globally unique.
              </p>
              <p>
                  Network administrators assign an IP address to each device connected to a network. Such assignments
                  may be on a static (fixed or permanent) or dynamic basis, depending on network practices and software
                  features.

              <h1>PACKETS</h1>
              <p>
                  In telecommunications and computer networking, a network packet is a formatted unit of data carried by
                  a packet-switched network. A packet consists of control information and user data;[1] the latter is
                  also known as the payload. Control information provides data for delivering the payload (e.g., source
                  and destination network addresses, error detection codes, or sequencing information). Typically,
                  control information is found in packet headers and trailers.
              </p>
              <p>
                  In packet switching, the bandwidth of the transmission medium is shared between multiple communication
                  sessions, in contrast to circuit switching, in which circuits are preallocated for the duration of one
                  session and data is typically transmitted as a continuous bit stream.

              <h1>ROUTING</h1>
              <p>
                  Routing is the process of selecting a path for traffic in a network or between or across multiple
                  networks. Broadly, routing is performed in many types of networks, including circuit-switched
                  networks, such as the public switched telephone network (PSTN), and computer networks, such as the
                  Internet.
              </p>
              <p>
                  In packet switching networks, routing is the higher-level decision making that directs network packets
                  from their source toward their destination through intermediate network nodes by specific packet
                  forwarding mechanisms. Packet forwarding is the transit of network packets from one network interface
                  to another. Intermediate nodes are typically network hardware devices such as routers, gateways,
                  firewalls, or switches. General-purpose computers also forward packets and perform routing, although
                  they have no specially optimized hardware for the task.
              </p>
              <p>
                  The routing process usually directs forwarding on the basis of routing tables. Routing tables maintain
                  a record of the routes to various network destinations. Routing tables may be specified by an
                  administrator, learned by observing network traffic or built with the assistance of routing protocols.
              </p>
              <p>
                  Routing, in a narrower sense of the term, often refers to IP routing and is contrasted with bridging.
                  IP routing assumes that network addresses are structured and that similar addresses imply proximity
                  within the network. Structured addresses allow a single routing table entry to represent the route to
                  a group of devices. In large networks, structured addressing (routing, in the narrow sense)
                  outperforms unstructured addressing (bridging). Routing has become the dominant form of addressing on
                  the Internet. Bridging is still widely used within local area networks.
